# This space is dedicated for Potential Deliverables, as requested on Gitcoin:

"As these bounties are broad and left up to your own discretion, we expect you to deliver the following items tailored for your specific solution:

## A specific problem area, user, and use case for which you are solving
We don't have a specific area, not even a specific user. Our use cases aim to reach as many locations and citizens as possible. Initially the idea is to reach an area of poorer population, where consequently there is more pollution and people engaged in the cause.

## Unique insights about the problem area gathered through primary or secondary research
We got in touch with "XÃ”, PLASTICO", a local Brazilian initiative - [you can read the Research clicking this link.](https://github.com/RenanMeirelles/zero-pollution-bsic/blob/master/Institutional/Potential%20Deliverables/Research.md)

## Evidence of team-wide entrepreneurial behavior and spirit throughout the incubator
With the initial difficulty in assembling a team, we are only in 2 - one focused on business and the other developer. 
Renan (Business) is not working at the moment, and because of the isolation due to the Coronavirus, had more time to focus on designing the idea. Paulo (Developer) is working hard, so he participated in specific conversations with a focus on development as defined.

## Proof that the solution you've identified is primed to advance this issue in the next 6-12 months
Unfortunately, with the economic and social uncertainty that is to come, due to the pandemic, we were unable to predict the operation of the project in 6 to 12 months. But if there is support for the development of the project, we believe that we have a sufficient basis for execution - at least the defined **MVP**.

## Proof that blockchain adds significant value to this solution over centralized alternatives"
