# BRANDING

## Visual Identity

### The Name:
ZOPO is the abbreviation of ZerO POllution. And it's such an easy name to remember.

### Logo:
![ZOPO_LOGO](https://scontent.fvcp2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/89068046_176632217119523_7264249896222326784_n.png?_nc_cat=106&_nc_sid=b96e70&_nc_ohc=4vaa9zBh2AMAX-1Ehlv&_nc_ht=scontent.fvcp2-1.fna&oh=7eb732c87cc6e4a0264fd68987dfc330&oe=5E923F2A)

The ZOPO Logo shows a clean and fresh nature view - Water, Plants, Air.

Thinking of the chemical molecules in plastic, we made a combination and ideas and arrived at the writing **Z⬡P⬡**, replacing the letter O with ⬡.

### Main Colours:
#30f271 - Green

#3d4954 - Dark Grey

#4c96d7 - Light Blue

#ffffff - White

### Z⬡P⬡ Bags - Used by Citizens to collect the Plastic waste:

    - Produced using recycled and biodegradable plastic, ZOPO bags were thought to be practical and comfortable for those who collect plastic waste. 
    - Every produced Z⬡P⬡ Bag must have an Eth Address (hash) and a QR Code to be scanned. 
    - A % of the collected Plastic waste will be used to produce more Bags!
    - Each Checkpoint must request a batch of ZOPO bags - each one will be associated with the Checkpoint Address - and then with the Citizen's Address. 
    - The used Bags must return to the Checkpoints and go to their Destinations - Recycling Industries and other Endpoints.

*PS1: It will be necessary to do a better job in producing the bags for better design and usability - transparency, seal, etc.*
*PS2: The initial production of the ZOPO Bags will need a sponsor or a fundraiser. Maybe we need to think an ICO or something like.*

### We are open to suggestions for changes!
