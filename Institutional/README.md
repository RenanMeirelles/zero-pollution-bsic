# ZOPO Core 
### Mission
Engage and reward people committed to helping the environment, through the collection of plastic waste, with the support of a Blockchain Ecosystem.

### Vision
Initially, we need to ally ourselves with smaller, independent/local projects in order to gain strength. In the future, we want to scale to be a worldwide initiative, especially in places with less structure and money.

### Values
We believe in **people power**. Together, citizens and companies can make the difference (we will not distinguish social class or any type of label). Little by little, we can reduce the plastic waste disposed of in the environment.

# Branding and Marketing

## Visual Identity

### The Name:
ZOPO is the abbreviation of ZerO POllution. And it's such an easy name to remember.

### Logo:
![ZOPO_LOGO](https://scontent.fvcp2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/89068046_176632217119523_7264249896222326784_n.png?_nc_cat=106&_nc_sid=b96e70&_nc_ohc=if2JGk5k_MkAX9wmSya&_nc_ht=scontent.fvcp2-1.fna&oh=c5c18345ebd79c96dab47c12ec264f30&oe=5EC5A9AA)

The ZOPO Logo shows a clean and fresh nature view - Water, Plants, Air.

Thinking of the chemical molecules in plastic, we made a combination and ideas and arrived at the writing **Z⬡P⬡**, replacing the letter O with ⬡.

### Main Colours:
- #30f271 - Green
- #3d4954 - Dark Grey
- #4c96d7 - Light Blue
- #ffffff - White

  - Produced using recycled and biodegradable plastic.
  - ZOPO bags were thought to be practical and comfortable for those who collect plastic waste. 
  - Every produced Z⬡P⬡ Bag must have an Eth Address (hash) and a QR Code to be scanned. 
  - A % of the collected Plastic waste will be used to produce more Bags!
  - Each Checkpoint must request a batch of ZOPO bags. Each bag will be associated with the Checkpoint Address.
  - When checked out by a Citizen, the Bag's hash will be associated with the Citizen's Address.
  - Used Bags must return to the Checkpoints and go to their Destinations - Recycling Industries and other Endpoints.

*PS1: It will be necessary to do a better job in producing the bags for better design and usability - transparency, seal, etc.*

*PS2: The initial production of the ZOPO Bags will need a sponsor or a fundraiser. Maybe we need to think an ICO or something like.*
