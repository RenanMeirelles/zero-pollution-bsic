```sh
As a Citizen I want to checkin my ZOPO Bag in a Checkpoint, so that I can start the Wheighing process.
```

After collecting the plastic garbage, the citizen can return to Checkpoint (or go to another one?) to checkin the bag with the plastic content. Once Checkin is done, the weighing process will begin


### Acceptance Criteria:
- Citizen needs to click the Checkin button in the initial screen;
- DApp will lock the screen and the Citizen will not be able to checkout another bag;
- Citizen can cancel the Checkin and return to the plastic collecting;
- After Citizen clicks the Checkin button, the Checkpoint will be able to scan the bag QR Code to start the wheighing process;
- *Check if Citizen needs to retur to the same Checkpoint or can go to another*
