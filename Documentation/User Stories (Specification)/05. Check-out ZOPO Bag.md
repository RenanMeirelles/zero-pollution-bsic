```sh
As a Citizen I want to checkout a ZOPO Bag in a Checkpoint, so that I can start the plastic collecting.
```

After the citizen goes to a Checkpoint, he/she can check out a ZOPO bag and start collecting plastic waste. Citizen must scan the ZOPO Bag QR Code and confirm the association of his Ethereum Address X ZOPO Bag Address.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Citizen must click the **CHECKOUT ZOPO BAG** option in the initial screen;
- DApp must open a QR Code scanner;
- Citizen needs to request a bag to the Checkpoint Admin and scan the ZOPO Bag QR Code;
- After that, the Citizen's Address will be associated to the ZOPO Bag Address;
- Citizen will not be able to do another checkout until the checkin is made;
- No need to check the Citizen Credentials. The QR Code scan will check if the Address is valid;
- *In another version, we can check if the Checkpoint needs to confirm the Checkout*;
