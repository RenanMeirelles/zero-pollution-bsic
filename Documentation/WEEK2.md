# **02/24 - 03/02 : Pain Points and User Story**


### Who are your constituents/clients/users? (Create User Persona(s))
| Roles | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Citizens | people who wants to make the difference. Just connect with Eth Wallet and start the work |
| Checkpoints | Entities that are able to contribute to the revolution - entepreneurs, establishments, street points. . . |
| Volunteers | CONFIRM if there will be a role to help the ecosystem - logistics, and other stuff|
| Endpoints | the final destination of the collected garbage - and the beginning - enterprises that are interested in the use of the plastic, reclycling industries, other. . . |

### What are their pain points?
  - How to produce the initial material, like bags, scales, banners and other things? ICO?
  - How to promote the Ecosystem?
  - How to convince people and entrepreneurs to register as **Checkpoints or/and Endpoints**?
  - How to convince establishments to receive the token as a payment or discount (Endpoints)? What do they receive as a benefit?
  - How to prevent fraud on trash wheighing?
  - How is gonna work the logistics operation, such as material distribution, bags collecting on checkpoints, distribution to other enterprises...
  - Who will pay the GAS of the Ethereum transactions? Like minting Tokens? Check https://medium.com/portis/sponsor-your-users-gas-fees-with-portis-and-tabookey-s-gas-stations-network-7fd7c8406869
  - Does somebody needs to have control of the token, such as burn when needed, or pause if somebody tries to crack the system?
  - . . .

### What is your product's value proposition?
Our idea is to propose a complete ecosystem, where Citizens of any social class can play important roles in engaging against excessive plastic pollution in the environment, using the Ethereum blockchain as a support. A complete cycle will be created, where citizens will be able to collect and take the garbage to authorized points (Checkpoints) - the plastic bags will be sent to recycling companies, which will generate new bags and other possible destinations. Best of all, everyone will be rewarded with ERC20 Tokens that can be used in partner establishments. After all, people are driven by rewards.

### What is your distribution and go-to-market strategy? Who can you partner with?
That will be the hardest part. We have in mind some potential and successful Partners that could engage this project, such as [Bounty for Basura](https://filmfreeway.com/thebountyforbasura), [Plastic Bank](https://plasticbank.com/) and [4Ocean](https://4ocean.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAkePyBRCEARIsAMy5Scv1ReNjhkw3qezXzpDUJHxaFYV4chm9RibYj0tS6OHA0EnjwA3x75gaAjRoEALw_wcB). If they enjoy the proposed idea, it can be a great kickoff.
Plastic recycling industries can also become partners, as the project increases the inputs for their production.

### What are the risks associated with your solution?
  - The principal risk is the rejection of the enterprises on being Checkpoints or Endpoints.

### What is the impact of your solution? How will it be measured?
  - The impact can only be measured after the society engagement. We can develop a Analytic Smart Contract to measure some KPI's, such as: Number of Engaged Citizens, Checkpoints and Endpoints (by Location); Quantity of plastic collected/used by Citizen, Checkpoint and Endpoint; Total trash collected and recycled by region; and a lot of possible Key-Performance-Indicators.

### Define the technical specifications and development roadmap
  - Token Implementation - **DESCRIBE THE TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE!!!**
  - dApp Implementation (MVP)- **DESCRIBE THE TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE!!!**
  - Contracts Implementation (MVP) - **DESCRIBE THE TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE!!!**
  - dApp and Contracts improvements
