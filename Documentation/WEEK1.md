## Specific Problem:
  - **Why is blockchain needed to solve this problem?**
  
Blockchain is a potential technology to empower radical changes in the world. Thinking about a full Ecosystem, we can go further. We can think abou getting rid of government hands, about rewards using a specific Token, the traceability of the  addresses of the plastic waste, the reliability of the information, and more. When the web3 become stronger, we'll have a lot of protocols to connect with this ecosystem, such as Decentralized Identity and other examples.
  
  - **What demographics do you serve? What is the size of the market?**
  
  The idea is to serve all social classes - but it is possible that the emerging class is more attainable. We will not focus only on coastal populations, because we know that Brazil, for example, we have trash anywhere you go. The size of the Market is something to be studied. We can reach since the Citizens until big corporations, such as Recylcing Industries, TradeMarks (Billabong for example), Partner Projects, Governments, and whoever wants to participate.
  
  - **What other solutions are currently being used to address this problem? (other companies, workarounds, systems or processes that can compete with or substitute your product)**
  
  During the BSIC webinars, we heard about the [Bounty for Basura](https://filmfreeway.com/thebountyforbasura) and the [Plastic Bank](https://plasticbank.com/) - and we see  them as potential partners. Another famous project is the [4Ocean](https://4ocean.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAkePyBRCEARIsAMy5Scv1ReNjhkw3qezXzpDUJHxaFYV4chm9RibYj0tS6OHA0EnjwA3x75gaAjRoEALw_wcB).  Most of them are focused on sea recovering, but the plastic in some cities are scattered anywhere.
  
  - **What are the geopolitical, cultural-social-economic factors that must be taken into consideration? What are some nuances and complexities that must be addressed?**
  
  First, let's talk about the **cultural** factor. We know that, especially in emerging countries, the base of the problem is the educational structure. And then, we enter the **political** area: lack of investment both to form an educational base and to solve the massive pollution problem. However, lately we have seen a generation thirsting for environmental justice. With an accredited project of this size that can involve people who suffer from the government's destitution, with the potential for an **environmental revolution**.
