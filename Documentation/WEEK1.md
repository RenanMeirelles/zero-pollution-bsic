## Specific Problem:
  - **Why is blockchain needed to solve this problem?**
  
  Write the text with the Mentor - Talk about getting rid of government, about rewards using a specific Token, the traceability of the addresses of the trash, etc.
  Talk that the Citizens and Entepreneur must mobilize something like that, to not depend on Governments.
  
  - **What demographics do you serve? What is the size of the market?**
  ...
  
  - **What other solutions are currently being used to address this problem?

  Bounties Network, Plastic Bank and 4Ocean. Most of them are focused on sea recovering, but the plastic in some cities are scattered anywhere.
  
  - **What are the geopolitical, cultural-social-economic factors that must be taken into consideration? 
  What are some nuances and complexities that must be addressed?**
