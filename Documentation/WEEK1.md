## Specific Problem:
  - **Why is blockchain needed to solve this problem?**
  
  Write the text with the Mentor - Talk about getting rid of government, about rewards using a specific Token, the traceability of the addresses of the trash, etc.Talk that the Citizens and Entepreneur must mobilize something like that, to not depend on Governments.
  
  - **What demographics do you serve? What is the size of the market?**
  The idea is to serve all social classes - but it is possible that the emerging class is more attainable. We will not focus only on coastal populations, because we know that Brazil, for example, we have trash anywhere you go. The size of the Market is something to be studied. We can reach since the Citizens until big corporations, such as Recylcing Industries, TradeMarks (Billabong for example), Partner Projects, Governments, and whoever wants to participate.
  
  - **What other solutions are currently being used to address this problem? 
  (other companies, workarounds, systems or processes that can compete with or substitute your product)**
  
  During the BSIC webinars, we heard about the [Bounty for Basura](https://filmfreeway.com/thebountyforbasura) and the [Plastic Bank](https://plasticbank.com/) - and we see  them as potential partners. Another famous project is the [4Ocean](https://4ocean.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAkePyBRCEARIsAMy5Scv1ReNjhkw3qezXzpDUJHxaFYV4chm9RibYj0tS6OHA0EnjwA3x75gaAjRoEALw_wcB).  Most of them are focused on sea recovering, but the plastic in some cities are scattered anywhere.
  
  - **What are the geopolitical, cultural-social-economic factors that must be taken into consideration? 
  What are some nuances and complexities that must be addressed?**
