**Value Proposition**
Our idea is to propose a complete ecosystem, where Citizens of any social class can play important roles in engaging against excessive plastic pollution in the environment, using the Ethereum blockchain as a support. A complete cycle will be created, where citizens will be able to collect and take the garbage to authorized points (Checkpoints) - the plastic bags will be sent to recycling companies, which will generate new bags and other possible destinations. Best of all, everyone will be rewarded with ERC20 Tokens that can be used in partner establishments. After all, people are driven by rewards.


## Personas

| **Citizens** | Anyone who wants to contribute to the ecosystem/environment by collecting garbage and receiving rewards. |
| **Checkpoints** | Entities that make the focal point of the ecosystem, contributing to its functioning - entepreneurs, establishments, street points and others. This role will be rewarded too.|
| **Volunteers** | CONFIRM if there will be a role to help the ecosystem - logistics, wheighing the garbage, and ohter activities.
| **Endpoints** | The final destination of the collected garbage - and the beginning - enterprises that are interested in the use of the plastic, reclycling industries, and others. |
