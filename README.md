# Plastic Pollution - a HUGE PROBLEM to be solved
**Plastic pollution** has reached almost inestimable levels in the whole world - seas, rivers, streets and lots of public places are affected by. This pollution can be caused by several factors of origin, such as lack of education of the population, irregular disposal of large producers, lack of investment in selective collection, among others.  The fact is, we need to find **a way to stop it**! 

**Some important data - [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution):**
- From 1950 to 2015 it is estimated that **7.8 billion tons** of plastic were produced in the world.
- Estimated share of global plastic waste by disposal method (2015): **19.5% is Recycled / 25.5% is Incinerated / 55% is Discarded**.
- Per capita rate of plastic waste generation by Country, measured in kilograms per person per day: **USA 0.34kg / Germany 0.48kg / Poland 0.1kg / Denmark 0.05kg**
- Total waste of Plastic by Country in 2010 (tonnes): **USA 37mi / China 59mi / Brazil 11mi**

## Specific Problem - Brazilian Pollution
Brazil can be considered a good case to be analyzed. It is a large country, with high economic, cultural and social potential, but we can still find a lot of garbage and pollution with plastic spread all over the place - both in poorer places and in upscale neighborhoods.  A lot of this is due to a lack of education and also a lack of investment in selective collection and recycling. The Government is unable to solve the problem alone. The solution should not be just to "remedy", but to tackle the root of the problem - but that is Government's responsibility.

**Brazilian Data - check more [here](https://g1.globo.com/natureza/noticia/2019/03/04/brasil-e-o-4o-maior-produtor-de-lixo-plastico-do-mundo-e-recicla-apenas-1.ghtml)**
- Brazil is the **4th largest producer of plastic waste** (11.3mi tons/year) in the world, behind the United States, China and India;
- Brazil **recycles only 1%** of the plastic waste produced (145k tons);
- Each Brazilian citizen produces **1 kg of plastic waste per week**;

**Solution Attempts**
Some projects already exist for plastic waste collection in Brazi, such as **[Xô Plástico](https://www.instagram.com/xoplastico/?hl=en)**, a local initiative in Recife - Pernambuco. We did a **survey** with them, which can be analyzed **[HERE](https://github.com/RenanMeirelles/zero-pollution-bsic/blob/master/Institutional/Potential%20Deliverables/Research.md)**.

**Z⬡P⬡ Ecosystem** initially allied with projects like this, can become potential triggers for a **worldwide revolution**.

# Z⬡P⬡  Ecosystem Solution
### Value Proposition
Reduce Plastic Pollution on Earth close to ZERO, through **Citizen's** engagement, powered by a **decentralized blockchain ecosystem** and an **easy use DApp**.

### But, How?
A complete **(re)cycle** will be created, where **Citizens** will be able to **collect** and take the plastic garbage to authorized **Checkpoints** - the full plastic bags will be sent to **Endpoints**, which will generate new bags and other possible destinations. Best of all, everyone will be **rewarded** by the Checkpoints - earning Tokens or Bounties like products, services, and other stuff. After all, people are driven by rewards. And more: the plastic cycle can be **end-to-end tracked**!

You can find the **detailed Process** below!

### Ecosystem Personas (Roles)
| Roles | Description |
| ------ | ------ | 
| **Citizens** (MVP)| Anyone who wants to contribute to the ecosystem/environment by collecting garbage and receiving rewards. |
| **Checkpoints** (MVP)| Entities that make the focal point of the ecosystem, contributing to its functioning - entepreneurs, establishments, street points and others. This role will be rewarded too.|
| **Volunteers*** (MMP)| CONFIRM if there will be a role to help the ecosystem - logistics, wheighing the garbage, and ohter activities.
| **Endpoints** (MMP)| The final destination of the collected garbage - and the beginning - enterprises that are interested in the use of the plastic, reclycling industries, and others. |
| **Sponsors** (MMP)| People and Businesses that are intereted in supporting the project by investing some Stake! |

### Business Processes
This is the Macro View of the **Z⬡P⬡** Ecosystem.

### Storytelling - Use Cases
**1 - [Register as a Citizen](https://github.com/RenanMeirelles/zero-pollution-bsic/blob/master/Documentation/User%20Stories%20(Specification)/02.%20Register%20as%20a%20Citizen.md)**

>*"Alice usually runs in the park and always find plastic garbage thrown next to a river. She heard about a platform called ZOPO, and she wants to register to help collect the plastic trash."*

**Citizens** of any social class can easily register to participate using the DApp. 
For those who have a smartphone, just access the ZOPO through the [MetaMask](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask&hl=en) app. 
We also though about those who want to be part of it but **do not have a smartphone** - for this we will develop totems for registration in Checkpoints - future features.
In the future we can create our own wallet generator and use other providers - or even DID Providers (Civic, uPort...)

**2 - [Register as a Checkpoint](https://github.com/RenanMeirelles/zero-pollution-bsic/blob/master/Documentation/User%20Stories%20(Specification)/03.%20Register%20as%20a%20Checkpoint.md)**

>*"Bob, who owns a nearby store, also pays attention to this problem of plastic waste. He also heard about the ZOPO platform and decided to help by being a Checkpoint."*

At the same time, establishments of any type of segment may register as **Checkpoints**, which will be the basis for supporting Citizens. They will be responsible for distributing the ZOPO bags, proposing bounties to the Citizens and destinating the ZOPO Bags to the Endpoints. They can connect using MetaMask too, and need to fill a register form.

**3 - [Find Checkpoints](https://github.com/RenanMeirelles/zero-pollution-bsic/blob/master/Documentation/User%20Stories%20(Specification)/04.%20Find%20Checkpoints.md)**

>*"Alice, already registered as a **Citizen**, went for a run again and found what she expected. So, she opened the DApp and checked the map available at ZOPO Dapp. She found Bob's store, which was a 2 blocks away, offering a Token reward.*

To facilitate finding Checkpoints, Citizens will have a feature called **"Find Checkpoints"** - they will be able to locate the nearest Checkpoints and bounty information through the DApp map.

**4 - [Check-out ZOPO Bag](https://github.com/RenanMeirelles/zero-pollution-bsic/blob/master/Documentation/User%20Stories%20(Specification)/05.%20Check-out%20ZOPO%20Bag.md) and Collect Plastic waste**

>*"After finding the Checkpoint of interest, Alice moved to it. There she was able to Checkout a ZOPO Bag by scanning the QR Code and start the plastic waste collecting. She put all the plastic waste in the ZOPO Bag and returned to Checkpoint "*.

After the Citizen goes to a Checkpoint, he/she can check out a ZOPO bag and start collecting plastic waste. Citizen must scan the ZOPO Bag QR Code and confirm the association of his **Citizen Address** x **ZOPO Bag Address**. The DApp will lock the Checkout function, so the Citizen cannot take another bag.

**5 - [Check-in ZOPO Bag](https://github.com/RenanMeirelles/zero-pollution-bsic/blob/master/Documentation/User%20Stories%20(Specification)/06.%20Check-in%20ZOPO%20Bag.md)**

>*"When she returned to Checkpoint, she Checked-in the bag. Bob veryfied the content and confirmed that everything was OK. So, Bob sealed the ZOPO Bag and rewarded Alice with the promised bounty - gave her 10 ZOPO Tokens."*

To perform the Checkin, the Checkpoint must scan the **ZOPO Bag QR Code** and confirm the return of the same. After that, the Citizen will be able to Checkout another Bag if he/she want.

**5 - [Mint ZOPO Tokens](https://github.com/RenanMeirelles/zero-pollution-bsic/blob/master/Documentation/User%20Stories%20(Specification)/08.%20Mint%20ZOPO%20Tokens)**

>*As promised, Bob said he would give tokens to Alice as a reward. For that, Bob will have access to the" Mint Tokens "function, which should generate ZOPO Tokens directly to Alice's wallet"*
