# Value Proposition
Our idea is to propose a **complete ecosystem**, where **Citizens** of any social class can play important roles in engaging against **excessive plastic pollution** in the environment, using the **ZOPO dApp and Ethereum blockchain** as a support. A complete **(re)cycle** will be created, where citizens will be able to **collect** and take the plastic garbage to authorized **Checkpoints** - the plastic bags will be sent to **Endpoints**, which will generate new bags and other possible destinations. Best of all, everyone will be **rewarded with ERC20 Tokens** that can be used in partner establishments. After all, people are driven by rewards. And more: the plastic cycle can be **fully tracked**!

## Ecosystem Personas
| Roles | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Citizens** (MVP)| Anyone who wants to contribute to the ecosystem/environment by collecting garbage and receiving rewards. |
| **Checkpoints** (MVP)| Entities that make the focal point of the ecosystem, contributing to its functioning - entepreneurs, establishments, street points and others. This role will be rewarded too.|
| **Volunteers*** (MMP)| CONFIRM if there will be a role to help the ecosystem - logistics, wheighing the garbage, and ohter activities.
| **Endpoints** (MMP)| The final destination of the collected garbage - and the beginning - enterprises that are interested in the use of the plastic, reclycling industries, and others. |
| **Sponsors** (MMP)| People and Businesses that are intereted in supporting the project by investing some Stake! |

## BUSINESS PROCESSES
This is the Macro View of the **Z⬡P⬡** Ecosystem.

## DETAILED USE CASES
- [**Connect with MetaMask**](https://github.com/RenanMeirelles/zero-pollution-bsic/blob/master/Documentation/User%20Stories%20(Specification)/01.%20Connect%20With%20MetaMask.md)
This will be the user's first contact with the ecosystem. This first version of the Ecosystem, user can connect with an existing Ethereum Account. In the future we can create our own wallet generator and use other providers - or even DID Providers (Civic, uPort...)

- [**Register as a Citizen**](https://github.com/RenanMeirelles/zero-pollution-bsic/blob/master/Documentation/User%20Stories%20(Specification)/02.%20Register%20as%20a%20Citizen.md)
Allows the new user to be registered as a Citizen. It is not necessary to fill in mandatory fields, but user may have the option to fill in Name and ID. Citizen can skip and register only with his address.

- [**Register as a Checkpoint**](https://github.com/RenanMeirelles/zero-pollution-bsic/blob/master/Documentation/User%20Stories%20(Specification)/03.%20Register%20as%20a%20Checkpoint.md)
Allows the new user to register as a Checkpoint. User must fill in some mandatory information, for example Name and Location (to be found on the map).

- [**Find Checkpoints**](https://github.com/RenanMeirelles/zero-pollution-bsic/blob/master/Documentation/User%20Stories%20(Specification)/04.%20Find%20Checkpoints.md)
Allows the citizen to locate the checkpoints closest to a reference point (location or as defined). That way, Citizen can go to the location to start the Checkout process.

- [**Check-out ZOPO Bag**](https://github.com/RenanMeirelles/zero-pollution-bsic/blob/master/Documentation/User%20Stories%20(Specification)/05.%20Check-out%20ZOPO%20Bag.md)
After the Citizen goes to a Checkpoint, he/she can check out a ZOPO bag and start collecting plastic waste. Citizen must scan the ZOPO Bag QR Code and confirm the association of his **Citizen Address** x **ZOPO Bag Address**.

- [**Check-in ZOPO Bag**](https://github.com/RenanMeirelles/zero-pollution-bsic/blob/master/Documentation/User%20Stories%20(Specification)/06.%20Check-in%20ZOPO%20Bag.md)
After collecting the plastic garbage, the Citizen can return to Checkpoint (or go to another one?) to checkin the bag with the plastic content. Once Checkin is done, the weighing process will begin.

- [**Wheigh Collected Plastic**](https://github.com/RenanMeirelles/zero-pollution-bsic/blob/master/Documentation/User%20Stories%20(Specification)/07.%20Wheigh%20Collected%20Plastic)
When the Checkin is confirmed, the citizen must proceed with the weighing of the collected plastic. To do this, the checkpoint should scan the bag's QR Code, check the contents placed and weigh the scale.

- [**Mint ZOPO Tokens**](https://github.com/RenanMeirelles/zero-pollution-bsic/blob/master/Documentation/User%20Stories%20(Specification)/08.%20Mint%20ZOPO%20Tokens)
