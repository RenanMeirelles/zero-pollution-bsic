# Value Proposition
Our idea is to propose a **complete ecosystem**, where **Citizens** of any social class can play important roles in engaging against **excessive plastic pollution** in the environment, using the **ZOPO dApp and Ethereum blockchain** as a support. A complete **(re)cycle** will be created, where citizens will be able to **collect** and take the plastic garbage to authorized **Checkpoints** - the plastic bags will be sent to **Endpoints**, which will generate new bags and other possible destinations. Best of all, everyone will be **rewarded with ERC20 Tokens** that can be used in partner establishments. After all, people are driven by rewards. And more: the plastic cycle can be **fully tracked**!
